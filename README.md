# 🗳 Blockchain Voting System

A decentralized voting system built on the **Ethereum blockchain** using **Solidity**, **Truffle**, and **Web3.js**. This project ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting by leveraging blockchain technology.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
This project aims to solve the issue of voting fraud by creating a secure, decentralized voting system. Voters can cast their votes, and the results are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language
- **Truffle**: Development framework for Ethereum
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for testing
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end interface

## ✨ **Features**
- ✅ Only registered voters can vote
- ✅ Each voter can vote only once
- ✅ Votes are recorded immutably on the blockchain
- ✅ Real-time vote count display

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blockchain-voting-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd blockchain-voting-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start Ganache (local blockchain):
   ```bash
   ganache-cli
   ```
5. Deploy the smart contract to the local blockchain:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```
6. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## 📖 **Usage**
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the local blockchain.
2. Open the front-end interface in your browser.
3. Register as a voter and cast your vote.
4. View the vote count in real-time.
